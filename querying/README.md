Week 1 Querying Part 1

 0:00–4:13 — Getting started
Notes:
  Spreadsheets are fine for small, singleuser tasks, but they break down with 
growth, multi user access, and when we need for sure  correctness.
  Databases store data in tables with types and constraints to keep data 
consistent.
   SQL lets us filter, sort, join, and compute reproducibly.
  Core ideas: tables, primary keys, relationships, queries.

Why move from spreadsheets? (my answer)
 Spreadsheets get messy. Hard to enforce rules or relationships.
Collaboration causes version conflicts one always has to close a file for 
another to work in
Databases provide schemas, constraints, indexes, transactions for integrity.

 4:13–6:59 — Terms
